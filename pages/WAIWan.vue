      <p>
        WAI Wānaka’s vision is to safeguard and enhance water quality, ecosystem
        function and biodiversity within the Upper Clutha basin. <br /><br />
        Moving at pace, WAI Wānaka aims to connect the many individuals,
        community groups, iwi, landowners and businesses undertaking positive
        work towards building healthy ecosystems and supporting community
        wellbeing.<br /><br />
        Taking a whole-of-basin approach, WAI encourage and facilitate science
        (including planning, research and monitoring), community action and
        educational projects and programmes relating to these purposes.<br /><br />
        WAI Wānaka has received funding from Sustainable Business Network and
        the Ministry for Primary Industries to deliver measurable benefits for
        the environment alongside providing much-needed local employment. Part
        of this program was to help landholders in the Upper Clutha Basin to
        estimate farm greenhouse gas emissions.

      <h1>How we helped</h1>
      <p>
        EAS trained WAI Wānaka staff on the technical elements of greenhouse gas
        accounting in the agriculture sector and but that in context of the
        emerging sector regulation being proposed by
        <a href="https://hewakaekenoa.nz/">He Waka Eka Noa</a>
        . WAI Wānaka staff were then prepared to reach out to the agriculture
        sector as extension staff to support the landholders to develop a farm
        greenhouse gas figure. We also developed reporting templates and FAQs
        material to help with the communication and capacity building of
        landholders in the region.

      <h1>What Difference did we make?</h1>
      <p>
        With our support, WAI Wānaka staff have made great progress towards all
        landholders in the Upper Clutha Basin to estimate their greenhouse gas
        emissions. As a result, landholders in the District know more about the
        greenhouse gas impact of their businesses and can start to explore and
        understand the options they have available to meet the National
        Governments proposed reduction targets for the sector. People are
        starting to ask the hard questions on Agriculture and climate change
        mitigation in the District. These questions start the move towards
        change.
