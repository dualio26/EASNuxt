      <h1>Business Carbon Footprinting</h1>
      <p>
        A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by
        an individual, event, organization, service, place or product, expressed
        as carbon dioxide equivalent. Greenhouse gases, can be emitted through
        the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance, production of food,
        manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation
        and other services. Understanding your carbon footprint can help inform
        you of your environmental impact and help to prioritise areas of your
        life or business where you can make reductions.
