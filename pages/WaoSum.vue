      <h1>Wao Wanaka</h1>
      <p>
        Wao is a charitable trust dedicated to educating, inspiring and enabling
        New Zealand communities to accelerate beyond sustainability towards a
        thriving future. Based in the Southern Lakes region, Wao look to
        inspire, educate and enable communities to look towards the
        opportunities created by this transition and help to shape a future that
        looks towards not just a sustainable future, but one where people give
        back more than they take. <br /><br />
        Each year the Wao Summit is one of the trust's main events, providing an
        annual check-in for the community to see how they are tracking towards
        the vision. The 2021 Summit will focus on the cross-pollination of ideas
        and how people can collaboratively build more resilient communities.

      <h1>How we helped</h1>
      <p>
        Staff at EAS lead lead a series of workshops at the Wao Summit 2021
        focused on building capacity in greenhouse gas accounting. The workshops
        were designed to ensure that participants are informed and motivated to
        make reductions after the events. <br /><br />
        We designed the workshops into two phases:<br /><br />
        <b>Phase 1:</b> Work with a motivated small group of leading
        environmental tourism businesses from Wanaka to develop greenhouse gas
        footprints for their businesses so they each ‘Know their Number’. With
        this information a business specific Reduction Action Plan was developed
        based on Science Based Targets.<br /><br />
        <b>Phase 2:</b> Engage cross sector businesses and individuals during
        the summit week in a series of targeted workshops, bringing the Phase 1
        Leaders experiences to each of these workshops in a peer-to-peer
        learning environment.

      <h1>What Difference did we make?</h1>
      <p>
        EAS created an environment where small business owners have the tools
        and knowledge to make realistic and meaningful changes in their
        operations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The structure of the
        workshops provided a collaborative space where local small to medium
        businesses could discuss the possibilities of informing visitors to the
        tourist town of Wanaka of their impact from their visit and to provide
        opportunities to influence the local environment in a positive way. It
        is hoped that his information and the actions of Wanaka businesses will
        travel home with visitors and catalyse change in their home communities.
