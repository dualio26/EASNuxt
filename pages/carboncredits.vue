      <h1>Carbon Credits</h1>
      <p>
        EAS support New Zealand landowners to enter eligible forests into the
        Emissions Trading Scheme. <br /><br />
        Landholders currently have until December 2022 to register eligible land
        and generate New Zealand Emission Trading Scheme units for the period
        2018 – 2022. <br /><br />
        After the December 2022 the reporting period ends and landholders will
        not be able to register any carbon sequestered prior to December 2022.

      <h1>How we work with you</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Step 1 - Pre-feasibility Assessment</b><br />
        We check your land for existing eligible forests under the New Zealand
        Emissions Trading Scheme and work with you to define additional
        potential eligible lands or areas you wish to plant. We combine this
        information and provide you a report showing initial estimates of carbon
        credit potential to help you decide if it is worth proceeding to
        development. <br />
        <br />
        <b>Step 2 - Development</b><br />
        We work with you to collect all required documentation and evidence to
        enter your lands into the New Zealand Emission Trading Scheme. If your
        area is over 100ha we can ensure all the field work required is
        completed in accordance with the Ministry requirements. At the
        completion of this stage your eligible forest areas are registered and
        any carbon credits registered. <br />
        <br />
        <b>Step 3 – Ongoing Reporting</b><br />
        We file your returns during the reporting period and ensure your
        registered forests meet all the regulatory reporting requirements
