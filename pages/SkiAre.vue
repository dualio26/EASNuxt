        Made up of representatives from commercial and club ski fields across
        New Zealand, SAANZ’s sustainability group, approached EAS well aware of
        the impacts that climate change can have on the future of the ski and
        snow-sports industry; an industry so intrinsically linked to weather,
        nature and the environment.

      <h1>How we helped</h1>
      <p>
        In preparation for the 2021 Winter Ski Season, EAS supported the Ski
        Area Association of New Zealand (SAANZ) to create a greenhouse gas
        inventory calculator which will allow them to estimate their
        environmental impact as an organization for the first time.<br /><br />
        Following the guidance of the
        <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">GHG Protocol</a>, ISO standard for
        Organizational Greenhouse Gas Accounting 14064:1 and guidance from the
        Ministry of Environment of New Zealand, SAANZ’s and EAS carried out
        workshops to establish their organizational boundaries and emissions
        activities (known as scopes) which were common across the organization
        and will be accounted for in the inventory.<br /><br />
        With the emissions producing activities defined, EAS created a bespoke
        calculator tool which will allow individual ski fields in enter their
        input data, such as the total kWh of electricity purchased and litres of
        diesel fuel burnt, in order to calculate their total emissions across a
        year.

      <h1>What Difference did we make?</h1>
      <p>
        The calculator tool was distributed to SAANZ’s members across the
        country to be used for the 2021 Winter Season to allow ski fields across
        New Zealand to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions for the first
        time. Once the data is collected for this first baseline year, EAS will
        support the individual ski fields to understand their emissions profiles
        and provide technical guidance and recommendations for ways to reduce
        their emissions and impact on the climate.<br /><br />
        This guidance can include technical solutions for energy efficiency
        improvements, options for offsetting emissions and progression to
        independent environmental verification.<br /><br />
        SAANZ hope that our collaborative work in this field will help to inform
        and inspire their staff, patrons and the wider local and snowsports
        communities to work together to operate sustainably and reduce their
        industry’s impact on our environment.
